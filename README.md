## Notes

- Virtual environments and Python cache/build artifacts are ignored via `.gitignore`.
- Some folders and filenames were normalized (spaces/special characters) to improve consistency.
- If you add new content, please place it in the appropriate top-level folder to keep things organized.

## Getting Started

- Use a Python 3.x environment (virtualenv or conda recommended).
- Most scripts can be run directly. Refer to chapter folders for topic-wise examples.
